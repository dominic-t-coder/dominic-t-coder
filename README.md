- 👋 Hi, I’m @dominic-t-coder
- 👀 I’m interested in coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL. I have enrolled to University for Boot Camp and I applied for Diversity in Tech Scholarship which will knock out £4000 of £6000 plus VAT total cost. The course starts on 29/03/2021 and I'm trying to raise £2000 before then, so if you are willing to help me to succeed you can donate crypto to my wallet.

- My crypto wallets addresses:
- - Bitcoin wallet address on Coinbase: 3BEMpX7jTRCNEyewtEizceMB1YhoCznM1h
- - Bitcoin wallet address on KuCoin: 33EC1VLHQpj7Ypm7gM2n3q2pCHwwqfWCxZ

- I know sending Bitcoin can be expencieve so you can send in ALGO too
- - ALGO wallet on Coinbase: 6ZOCDISC7H4535DZ3GYXBDNQ2632U2EFA5QIHR6S4Q2KNZB7GNHTR4LS44
- - ALGO wallet on KuCoin: PHL7QBAIPJY66PREIB3VU3DV2GPIQVAZD5Y4KNUXIW3VGVYMPIRPKYDFWQ

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some interesting Project with Crypto in the near Future after finishing my study also I would like to design and create API for crypto.

- Thank you all for your donation and for your kindness. Much appritiated.
